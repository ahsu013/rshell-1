RSHELL - HW #1
======

This project contains the rudimentary foundation for a shell. While limited, it can execute a number of bash commands with proper arguments, syntax, etc. This program makes use of command connectors (&&, ||, ;) which are evaulated from left to right---this works just like the bash terminal



<h1>BUGS</h1>

<ol>
    <li>There can't be more than one space at a time. For example: "echo  [insert whitespace]   x" is the same as "echo x"</li>
    <li>The $ prompt won't display properly if the enter button is spammed, but this was reproduced in the bash terminal, too.</li>
    
</ol>
